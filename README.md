## Introduction
<strong> A factorial experiment has been conducted to study the effect of threefactors (A,B,C) on 'response' with 'covariate' as the covariate. Three observations are taken under each treatment. Three levels of factor A ('1','2','3')
five levels for factor B ('1','2','3','4','5') and three levels of factor C has been concidered. All 45 treatment has been investigated. </strong>

## Methodology
### Data Coolection
Three compounds were taken and each was prepared under five specified concentration in such a way that, each canbe used for nine experiments. Three glucose levels were applied to 3 units under each concentration. Under each condition 
'respose' and 'covariate' was recorded.
